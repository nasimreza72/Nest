                            We in Nest wants to connect refugees with people who wants to help by giving them lasting or temporary homes.
                            In the past decade the global refugee population has more than doubled. Currently there are 26.6 million refugees, the highest refugee population on record.
                            We in Nest want to offer  solutions to this situation by creating a user friendly website, with features especially tailored to the need of refugees.
                            However this page is not only serving the needs of refugees, but also the need for helping others and being a useful member of society. 
                            It is one of life big tasks to find meaning in your personal life. Few things gives stronger meaning to life than the gratitude in someones eyes whom you just helped.
                            We believe the world is full of such individuals.
                            As we progress on this journey of creating this project, new ideas and features are developing as we go along. 
                            In our message board, where host and refugee can communicate, text messages will be translated in real time. Making communcation effortless.
